In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pinctrl: apple: check devm_kasprintf() returned value devm_kasprintf() can return a NULL pointer on failure but this returned value is not checked. Fix this lack and check the returned value. Found by code review.
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/fbdev-dma: Only cleanup deferred I/O if necessary Commit 5a498d4d06d6 ("drm/fbdev-dma: Only install deferred I/O if necessary") initializes deferred I/O only if it is used. drm_fbdev_dma_fb_destroy() however calls fb_deferred_io_cleanup() unconditionally with struct fb_info.fbdefio == NULL. KASAN with the out-of-tree Apple silicon display driver posts following warning from __flush_work() of a random struct work_struct instead of the expected NULL pointer derefs.

gix-path is a crate of the gitoxide project dealing with git paths and their conversions. `gix-path` executes `git` to find the path of a configuration file that belongs to the `git` installation itself, but mistakenly treats the local repository's configuration as system-wide if no higher scoped configuration is found. In rare cases, this causes a less trusted repository to be treated as more trusted, or leaks sensitive information from one repository to another, such as sending credentials to another repository's remote. In `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` and parses the first line of the output to extract the path to the configuration file holding the configuration variable of highest scope. It is believed to be very difficult to exploit this vulnerability deliberately, due to the need either to anticipate a situation in which higher-scoped configuration variables would be absent, or to arrange for this to happen. Although any operating system may be affected, users running Apple Git on macOS are much less likely to be affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.10.10. All users are advised to upgrade.
A stack buffer overflow was addressed through improved input validation. This issue is fixed in Apple TV 1.5.0.152 for Windows, iTunes 12.13.3 for Windows. Parsing a maliciously crafted video file may lead to unexpected system termination.
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nvme: apple: fix device reference counting Drivers must call nvme_uninit_ctrl after a successful nvme_init_ctrl. Split the allocation side out to make the error handling boundary easier to navigate. The apple driver had been doing this wrong, leaking the controller device memory on a tagset failure.
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: xhci: Handle TD clearing for multiple streams case When multiple streams are in use, multiple TDs might be in flight when an endpoint is stopped. We need to issue a Set TR Dequeue Pointer for each, to ensure everything is reset properly and the caches cleared. Change the logic so that any N&gt;1 TDs found active for different streams are deferred until after the first one is processed, calling xhci_invalidate_cancelled_tds() again from xhci_handle_cmd_set_deq() to queue another command until we are done with all of them. Also change the error/"should never happen" paths to ensure we at least clear any affected TDs, even if we can't issue a command to clear the hardware cache, and complain loudly with an xhci_warn() if this ever happens. This problem case dates back to commit e9df17eb1408 ("USB: xhci: Correct assumptions about number of rings per endpoint.") early on in the XHCI driver's life, when stream support was first added. It was then identified but not fixed nor made into a warning in commit 674f8438c121 ("xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two steps"), which added a FIXME comment for the problem case (without materially changing the behavior as far as I can tell, though the new logic made the problem more obvious). Then later, in commit 94f339147fc3 ("xhci: Fix failure to give back some cached cancelled URBs."), it was acknowledged again. [Mathias: commit 94f339147fc3 ("xhci: Fix failure to give back some cached cancelled URBs.") was a targeted regression fix to the previously mentioned patch. Users reported issues with usb stuck after unmounting/disconnecting UAS devices. This rolled back the TD clearing of multiple streams to its original state.] Apparently the commit author was aware of the problem (yet still chose to submit it): It was still mentioned as a FIXME, an xhci_dbg() was added to log the problem condition, and the remaining issue was mentioned in the commit description. The choice of making the log type xhci_dbg() for what is, at this point, a completely unhandled and known broken condition is puzzling and unfortunate, as it guarantees that no actual users would see the log in production, thereby making it nigh undebuggable (indeed, even if you turn on DEBUG, the message doesn't really hint at there being a problem at all). It took me *months* of random xHC crashes to finally find a reliable repro and be able to do a deep dive debug session, which could all have been avoided had this unhandled, broken condition been actually reported with a warning, as it should have been as a bug intentionally left in unfixed (never mind that it shouldn't have been left in at all). &gt; Another fix to solve clearing the caches of all stream rings with &gt; cancelled TDs is needed, but not as urgent. 3 years after that statement and 14 years after the original bug was introduced, I think it's finally time to fix it. And maybe next time let's not leave bugs unfixed (that are actually worse than the original bug), and let's actually get people to review kernel commits please. Fixes xHC crashes and IOMMU faults with UAS devices when handling errors/faults. Easiest repro is to use `hdparm` to mark an early sector (e.g. 1024) on a disk as bad, then `cat /dev/sdX &gt; /dev/null` in a loop. At least in the case of JMicron controllers, the read errors end up having to cancel two TDs (for two queued requests to different streams) and the one that didn't get cleared properly ends up faulting the xHC entirely when it tries to access DMA pages that have since been unmapped, referred to by the stale TDs. This normally happens quickly (after two or three loops). After this fix, I left the `cat` in a loop running overnight and experienced no xHC failures, with all read errors recovered properly. Repro'd and tested on an Apple M1 Mac Mini (dwc3 host). On systems without an IOMMU, this bug would instead silently corrupt freed memory, making this a ---truncated---

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/amd/display: Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_config When slice_height is 0, the division by slice_height in the calculation of the number of slices will cause a division by zero driver crash. This leaves the kernel in a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds a check to avoid the division by zero. The stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. I reproduced the issue on a Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple Studio Display monitor connected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed with this exception when I rebooted the system with the monitor connected. kernel: ? die (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:421 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:434 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:447) kernel: ? do_trap (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:113 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:154) kernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel: ? do_error_trap (./arch/x86/include/asm/traps.h:58 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:175) kernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel: ? exc_divide_error (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:194 (discriminator 2)) kernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel: ? asm_exc_divide_error (./arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:548) kernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel: dc_dsc_compute_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1109) amdgpu After applying this patch, the driver no longer crashes when the monitor is connected and the system is rebooted.

Support App is an opensource application specialized in managing Apple devices. It's possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root. The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang `#!/bin/zsh` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for the users password to be executed as root. However, it'll still be using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file `$HOME/.zshenv` when the `postinstall` script is executed. An attacker could add malicious code to `$HOME/.zshenv` and it will be executed when the app is installed. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 2.5.1 Rev 2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
On Darwin, building a Go module which contains CGO can trigger arbitrary code execution when using the Apple version of ld, due to usage of the -lto_library flag in a "#cgo LDFLAGS" directive.
Sony XAV-AX5500 CarPlay TLV Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sony XAV-AX5500 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the Apple CarPlay protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-23238

A vulnerability in Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta) allows push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature allowing the authentication to proceed regardless of the user&amp;#8217;s selection. When a user long-presses the notification banner and selects an option, both options allow the authentication to succeed. The ContextExtension feature is one of several push mechanisms available when using Okta Verify Push on iOS devices. The vulnerable flows include: * When a user is presented with a notification on a locked screen, the user presses on the notification directly and selects their reply without unlocking the device; * When a user is presented with a notification on the home screen and drags the notification down and selects their reply; * When an Apple Watch is used to reply directly to a notification. A pre-condition for this vulnerability is that the user must have enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic. This applies irrespective of whether the organization has since upgraded to Okta Identity Engine.
In affected libpcap versions during the setup of a remote packet capture the internal function sock_initaddress() calls getaddrinfo() and possibly freeaddrinfo(), but does not clearly indicate to the caller function whether freeaddrinfo() still remains to be called after the function returns. This makes it possible in some scenarios that both the function and its caller call freeaddrinfo() for the same allocated memory block. A similar problem was reported in Apple libpcap, to which Apple assigned CVE-2023-40400.

Macvim is a text editor for MacOS. Prior to version 178, Macvim makes use of an insecure interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism which could lead to a privilege escalation. Distributed objects are a concept introduced by Apple which allow one program to vend an interface to another program. What is not made clear in the documentation is that this service can vend this interface to any other program on the machine. The impact of exploitation is a privilege escalation to root - this is likely to affect anyone who is not careful about the software they download and use MacVim to edit files that would require root privileges. Version 178 contains a fix for this issue.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: efi: runtime: avoid EFIv2 runtime services on Apple x86 machines Aditya reports [0] that his recent MacbookPro crashes in the firmware when using the variable services at runtime. The culprit appears to be a call to QueryVariableInfo(), which we did not use to call on Apple x86 machines in the past as they only upgraded from EFI v1.10 to EFI v2.40 firmware fairly recently, and QueryVariableInfo() (along with UpdateCapsule() et al) was added in EFI v2.00. The only runtime service introduced in EFI v2.00 that we actually use in Linux is QueryVariableInfo(), as the capsule based ones are optional, generally not used at runtime (all the LVFS/fwupd firmware update infrastructure uses helper EFI programs that invoke capsule update at boot time, not runtime), and not implemented by Apple machines in the first place. QueryVariableInfo() is used to 'safely' set variables, i.e., only when there is enough space. This prevents machines with buggy firmwares from corrupting their NVRAMs when they run out of space. Given that Apple machines have been using EFI v1.10 services only for the longest time (the EFI v2.0 spec was released in 2006, and Linux support for the newly introduced runtime services was added in 2011, but the MacbookPro12,1 released in 2015 still claims to be EFI v1.10 only), let's avoid the EFI v2.0 ones on all Apple x86 machines.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/nouveau: fix off by one in BIOS boundary checking Bounds checking when parsing init scripts embedded in the BIOS reject access to the last byte. This causes driver initialization to fail on Apple eMac's with GeForce 2 MX GPUs, leaving the system with no working console. This is probably only seen on OpenFirmware machines like PowerPC Macs because the BIOS image provided by OF is only the used parts of the ROM, not a power-of-two blocks read from PCI directly so PCs always have empty bytes at the end that are never accessed.

A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header "Foo" to the value "Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.
Xpdf prior to version 4.04 contains an integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder (JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg() in JBIG2Stream.cc).

Improper detection of complete HTTP body decompression SwiftNIO Extras provides a pair of helpers for transparently decompressing received HTTP request or response bodies. These two objects (HTTPRequestDecompressor and HTTPResponseDecompressor) both failed to detect when the decompressed body was considered complete. If trailing junk data was appended to the HTTP message body, the code would repeatedly attempt to decompress this data and fail. This would lead to an infinite loop making no forward progress, leading to livelock of the system and denial-of-service. This issue can be triggered by any attacker capable of sending a compressed HTTP message. Most commonly this is HTTP servers, as compressed HTTP messages cannot be negotiated for HTTP requests, but it is possible that users have configured decompression for HTTP requests as well. The attack is low effort, and likely to be reached without requiring any privilege or system access. The impact on availability is high: the process immediately becomes unavailable but does not immediately crash, meaning that it is possible for the process to remain in this state until an administrator intervenes or an automated circuit breaker fires. If left unchecked this issue will very slowly exhaust memory resources due to repeated buffer allocation, but the buffers are not written to and so it is possible that the processes will not terminate for quite some time. This risk can be mitigated by removing transparent HTTP message decompression. The issue is fixed by correctly detecting the termination of the compressed body as reported by zlib and refusing to decompress further data. The issue was found by Vojtech Rylko (https://github.com/vojtarylko) and reported publicly on GitHub.
NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and "inject" those newlines into the returned HTTP response. This capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests, which can lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type, ensuring that there's no whitespace incorrectly present in the HTTP headers provided by users. As the existing API surface is non-failable, all invalid characters are replaced by linear whitespace.
Pimcore is an Open Source Data &amp; Experience Management Platform. Pimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying data easier. This listing classes also allow to order or group the results based on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. The actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing classes. This issue has been resolved in version 10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to apple the patch manually. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Improper validation of the Apple certificate URL in the Apple Game Center authentication adapter allows attackers to bypass authentication, making the server vulnerable to DoS attacks. The vulnerability has been fixed by improving the URL validation and adding additional checks of the resource the URL points to before downloading it.
A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack caused by a network peer sending ALTSVC or ORIGIN frames. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error after frame parsing but before frame handling. ORIGIN and ALTSVC frames are not currently supported by swift-nio-http2, and should be ignored. However, one code path that encounters them has a deliberate trap instead. This was left behind from the original development process and was never removed. Sending an ALTSVC or ORIGIN frame does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send one of these frames. The impact on availability is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send these frames, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself. This is a controlled, intentional crash. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz.
A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HPACK-encoded header block. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. There are a number of implementation errors in the parsing of HPACK-encoded header blocks that allow maliciously crafted HPACK header blocks to cause crashes in processes using swift-nio-http2. Each of these crashes is triggered instead of an integer overflow. A malicious HPACK header block could be sent on any of the HPACK-carrying frames in a HTTP/2 connection (HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE), at any position. Sending a HPACK header block does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send one. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send an appropriately crafted field block. The impact on availability is high: receiving a frame carrying this field block immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted field blocks, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2 is parsing the field block in memory-safe code and the crash is triggered instead of an integer overflow. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle all conditions in the function. The principal issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz, but several associated bugs in the same code were found by code audit and fixed at the same time

Wire-ios is a messaging application using the wire protocol on apple's ios platform. In versions prior to 3.95 malformed resource identifiers may render the iOS Wire Client completely unusable by causing it to repeatedly crash on launch. These malformed resource identifiers can be generated and sent between Wire users. The root cause lies in [wireapp/wire-ios-transport](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport), where code responsible for removing sensible tokens before logging may fail and lead to a crash (Swift exception) of the application. This causes undesirable behavior, however the (greater) Wire system is still functional. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

A program using swift-corelibs-foundation is vulnerable to a denial of service attack caused by a potentially malicious source producing a JSON document containing a type mismatch. This vulnerability is caused by the interaction between a deserialization mechanism offered by the Swift standard library, the Codable protocol; and the JSONDecoder class offered by swift-corelibs-foundation, which can deserialize types that adopt the Codable protocol based on the content of a provided JSON document. When a type that adopts Codable requests the initialization of a field with an integer value, the JSONDecoder class uses a type-erased container with different accessor methods to attempt and coerce a corresponding JSON value and produce an integer. In the case the JSON value was a numeric literal with a floating-point portion, JSONDecoder used different type-eraser methods during validation than it did during the final casting of the value. The checked casting produces a deterministic crash due to this mismatch. The JSONDecoder class is often wrapped by popular Swift-based web frameworks to parse the body of HTTP requests and perform basic type validation. This makes the attack low-effort: sending a specifically crafted JSON document during a request to these endpoints will cause them to crash. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself; the crash is produced deterministically by an abort function that ensures that execution does not continue in the face of this violation of assumptions. However, unexpected crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it's possible that this attack can be used to trigger error conditions that escalate the risk. Producing a denial of service may also be the goal of an attacker in itself. This issue is solved in Swift 5.6.2 for Linux and Windows. This issue was solved by ensuring that the same methods are invoked both when validating and during casting, so that no type mismatch occurs. Swift for Linux and Windows versions are not ABI-interchangeable. To upgrade a service, its owner must update to this version of the Swift toolchain, then recompile and redeploy their software. The new version of Swift includes an updated swift-corelibs-foundation package. Versions of Swift running on Darwin-based operating systems are not affected.
A stack overflow bug in the document extractor in Mattermost Server in versions up to and including 6.3.2 allows an attacker to crash the server via submitting a maliciously crafted Apple Pages document.
A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 frame. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error when parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS or HTTP/2 PUSH_PROMISE frame where the frame contains padding information without any other data. This logical error caused confusion about the size of the frame, leading to a parsing error. This parsing error immediately crashes the entire process. Sending a HEADERS frame or PUSH_PROMISE frame with HTTP/2 padding information does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: HID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect Commit 9d7b18668956 ("HID: magicmouse: add support for Apple Magic Trackpad 2") added a sanity check for an Apple trackpad but returned success instead of -ENODEV when the check failed. This means that the remove callback will dereference the never-initialised driver data pointer when the driver is later unbound (e.g. on USB disconnect).
This issue was addressed by using HTTPS when sending information over the network. This issue is fixed in Apple Music 3.5.0 for Android. An attacker in a privileged network position can track a user's activity.
The Samba vfs_fruit module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide "...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver." Samba versions prior to 4.13.17, 4.14.12 and 4.15.5 with vfs_fruit configured allow out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended file attributes. A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of smbd, typically root.

&lt;p&gt;Depending on configuration of various package managers it is possible for an attacker to insert a malicious package into a package manager's repository which can be retrieved and used during development, build, and release processes. This insertion could lead to remote code execution. We believe this vulnerability affects multiple package managers across multiple languages, including but not limited to: Python/pip, .NET/NuGet, Java/Maven, JavaScript/npm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An attacker could take advantage of this ecosystem-wide issue to cause harm in a variety of ways. The original attack scenarios were discovered by Alex Birsan and are detailed in their whitepaper, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610"&gt;Dependency Confusion: How I Hacked Into Apple, Microsoft and Dozens of Other Companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With basic knowledge of the target ecosystems, an attacker could create an empty shell for a package and insert malicious code in the install scripts, give it a high version, and publish it to the public repository. Vulnerable victim machines will download the higher version of the package between the public and private repositories and attempt to install it. Due to code incompatibility it will probably error out upon import or upon compilation, making it easier to detect; however the attacker would have gained code execution by that point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An advanced attacker with some inside knowledge of the target could take a copy of a working package, insert the malicious code (in the package itself or in the install), and then publish it to a public repository. The package will likely install and import correctly, granting the attacker an initial foothold and persistence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;These two methods could affect target organizations at any of these various levels:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Developer machines&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;An entire team if the configuration to import the malicious package is uploaded to a code repository&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Continuous integration pipelines if they pull the malicious packages during the build, test, and/or deploy stages&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Customers, download servers, production services if the malicious code has not been detected&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This remote code execution vulnerability can only be addressed by reconfiguring installation tools and workflows, and not by correcting anything in the package repositories themselves. See the &lt;strong&gt;FAQ&lt;/strong&gt; section of this CVE for configuration guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

omniauth-apple is the OmniAuth strategy for "Sign In with Apple" (RubyGem omniauth-apple). In omniauth-apple before version 1.0.1 attackers can fake their email address during authentication. This vulnerability impacts applications using the omniauth-apple strategy of OmniAuth and using the info.email field of OmniAuth's Auth Hash Schema for any kind of identification. The value of this field may be set to any value of the attacker's choice including email addresses of other users. Applications not using info.email for identification but are instead using the uid field are not impacted in the same manner. Note, these applications may still be negatively affected if the value of info.email is being used for other purposes. Applications using affected versions of omniauth-apple are advised to upgrade to omniauth-apple version 1.0.1 or later.
** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the GAEN (aka Google/Apple Exposure Notifications) protocol through 2020-10-05, as used in COVID-19 applications on Android and iOS.

ZenMate 1.5.4 for macOS suffers from a type confusion vulnerability within the com.zenmate.chron-xpc LaunchDaemon component. The LaunchDaemon implements an XPC service that uses an insecure XPC API for accessing data from an inbound XPC message. This could potentially result in an XPC object of the wrong type being passed as the first argument to the xpc_connection_create_from_endpoint function if controlled by an attacker. In recent versions of macOS and OS X, Apple has implemented an internal check to prevent such XPC API abuse from occurring, thus making this vulnerability only result in a denial of service if exploited by an attacker.
