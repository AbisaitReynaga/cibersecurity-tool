The qemu_clipboard_request() function can be reached before vnc_server_cut_text_caps() was called and had the chance to initialize the clipboard peer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This could allow a malicious authenticated VNC client to crash QEMU and trigger a denial of service.

<td valign="top">On boot, the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content of &amp;#8220;/config/GlobalConfig/global.json&amp;#8221;. If the file exists, it overrides the existing configuration on the device on boot. This allows an attacker to change the system&amp;#8217;s configuration, which also includes some debug functions. This could be used to unlock the ssh with custom &amp;#8220;authorized_keys&amp;#8221; via the &amp;#8220;debug.enable.ssh&amp;#8221; key, similar to the &amp;#8220;authorized_keys&amp;#8221; finding that was noted before. Other usages include unlocking the usb to enable the keyboard via the &amp;#8220;debug.enable.usb&amp;#8221; key, allowing VNC access via the &amp;#8220;app.allow.vnc&amp;#8221; key, and more. An attacker could easily enable these debug functionalities without triggering the &amp;#8220;measured boot&amp;#8221; mechanism implemented by EVE OS, and without marking the device as &amp;#8220;UUD&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;Unknown Update Detected&amp;#8221;). This is because the &amp;#8220;/config&amp;#8221; partition is not protected by &amp;#8220;measured boot&amp;#8221;, it is mutable and it is not encrypted in any way. An attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values, thereby not triggering the &amp;#8220;measured boot&amp;#8221; mechanism, and having full access to the vault. Note: This issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa), where the config partition measurement was added to PCR13: &amp;#8226; aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141 &amp;#8226; 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889. This issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured boot.

<td valign="top">An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Neither xenstore implementation does any permission checks when reporting a xenstore watch event. A guest administrator can watch the root xenstored node, which will cause notifications for every created, modified, and deleted key. A guest administrator can also use the special watches, which will cause a notification every time a domain is created and destroyed. Data may include: number, type, and domids of other VMs; existence and domids of driver domains; numbers of virtual interfaces, block devices, vcpus; existence of virtual framebuffers and their backend style (e.g., existence of VNC service); Xen VM UUIDs for other domains; timing information about domain creation and device setup; and some hints at the backend provisioning of VMs and their devices. The watch events do not contain values stored in xenstore, only key names. A guest administrator can observe non-sensitive domain and device lifecycle events relating to other guests. This information allows some insight into overall system configuration (including the number and general nature of other guests), and configuration of other guests (including the number and general nature of other guests' devices). This information might be commercially interesting or might make other attacks easier. There is not believed to be exposure of sensitive data. Specifically, there is no exposure of VNC passwords, port numbers, pathnames in host and guest filesystems, cryptographic keys, or within-guest data.
